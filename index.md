## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Loan Defauters Driving Factors Analysis

The following notebook contains a typical exploratory data Analsyis steps starting from Data Cleaning, Standardise values, filter data, derive new variables, Univariate, Segmented Univariate, Bivariate Analysis and rendering of different plots using matplotlib, plotly and seaborn.

## Multiple Linear Regression

### Bike Sharing Prediction

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Compnay wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands.

This note book consists of complete end to end steps to solve the business problem by following the CRISP-DM framework starting from business understanding, data understanding, data visualization, data cleaning,  building linear regression model manually to select the features based on statistics (P-values and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), Analyze the residuals, evaluate the model. 

Notebook also consists of automated feature selection model, for which I started with Hyper parameter tuning using Grid search view cross validation in order to find out the optimal number of features followed by Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the top significant features and then build and evaluate the model. 
I ended of having almost same statistics for both manually selected features and RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) model.
